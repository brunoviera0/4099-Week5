Stock Data Collection:

To last week's stock data retrieval code, add functions to store data in Pandas and a Matplotlib chart, upload this visualization and the accompanying CSV file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Add a cronjob to the code that makes it run every weekday at 6PM EST, when the market closes.
